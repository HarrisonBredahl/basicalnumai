Numerical AI Basic
Imports and Dependencies:

The code begins by importing necessary libraries and modules. numpy is used for numerical operations, train_test_split from sklearn.model_selection is used to split data into training and test sets, LinearRegression is our basic AI model, and mean_squared_error is used to evaluate the model's performance.
Function Definitions:

generate_data(size=100): This function generates a set of data points. It produces linear data (i.e., data that follows a linear trend) with some random noise.

X: Input features. These are random numbers multiplied by 2.
y: Output/Target values. They're generated using the formula 
�
=
4
+
3
�
+
noise
y=4+3X+noise. This is essentially a linear equation in the form 
�
=
�
�
+
�
y=mx+c, where 
�
m is 3 and 
�
c is 4, with some added randomness (noise).
train_model(X, y): Accepts the input data X and target values y to train a linear regression model. It returns the trained model and the test data.

The data is split into training (80%) and test (20%) sets.
A linear regression model is initialized and then trained using the training data.
evaluate_model(model, X_test, y_test): This function is used to evaluate the trained model on the test data. It returns the mean squared error (MSE) which quantifies the model's prediction error.

Main Execution:

The user is prompted to enter the desired number of data points for the dataset. If nothing is provided, it defaults to 100.
The data is generated, the model is trained, and then the model is evaluated.
Finally, the code demonstrates how to use the trained model to make a prediction for a new input data point, in this case, an X value of 1.5.
How the model comes to its output:
The core AI model used here is Linear Regression. Linear Regression attempts to model the relationship between two variables by fitting a linear equation (a straight line) to the observed data. One variable is considered as an explanatory variable, and the other is considered as a dependent variable.

Given the equation:
�
=
�
�
+
�
y=mx+c

�
y is the dependent variable (what we're trying to predict).
�
x is the explanatory variable (input feature).
�
m is the slope of the line.
�
c is the y-intercept.
In the generate_data function, the data is generated using the equation 
�
=
4
+
3
�
+
noise
y=4+3x+noise. So, ideally, our trained model should come close to these values with 
�
m (slope) approximating 3 and 
�
c (y-intercept) approximating 4. The "noise" introduces randomness, making the data more realistic and the task of the model slightly more challenging.

When you use the trained model to predict the y value for an X value of 1.5 (or any other value), the model essentially plugs this X value into its learned linear equation to give you the predicted y.
